PentaLedger is a collaborative effort aimed at providing an accessible 
and feature-rich accounting solution for individuals and organizations of all 
sizes. Developed by a team of dedicated volunteers, this software is built 
on the principles of transparency, reliability, and community-driven innovation.

Why PentaLedger Exists
----------------------

PentaLedger was born out of frustration. As the creator of this software, I 
understand the pain points of dealing with complex and cumbersome accounting 
software like QuickBooks. I wanted to offer an alternative; a user-friendly, efficient 
solution that empowers users rather than frustrates them.

This user guide is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource to help 
you get started with PentaLedger. Whether you're new to accounting software 
or a seasoned professional, you'll find step-by-step instructions, 
tips, and best practices to make the most of our software.

We are committed to continuously improving PentaLedger to better 
serve our users. Your feedback is invaluable to us, so please don't 
hesitate to reach out with suggestions, bug reports, or contributions. 
Together, we can make PentaLedger even better!
